Orientation Program on Open Data, Free and Open Source Software, and
OpenStreetMap at "Butwal Campus"  
On June 3, 2022, the Open Tech Community conducted an orientation program at
"Butwal Campus" to introduce and educate participants about the concepts of
Open Data, Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), and OpenStreetMap. The
program aimed to raise awareness and promote the adoption of these open
technologies among the attendees.  
The program was facilitated by three knowledgeable speakers: Nirab Pudasaini,
Arjun Gautam, and James Shrestha. Each speaker provided insights and expertise
in their respective areas of specialization to ensure a comprehensive
understanding of the topics covered.  
Nirab Pudasaini shared valuable information about Open Data, emphasizing its
significance in today's data-driven world. He explained the principles of Open
Data, its benefits, and how it can contribute to transparency, innovation, and
social impact.  
Arjun Gautam focused on Free and Open Source Software, introducing the
audience to the concept and explaining the advantages and key features of
using FOSS. He highlighted how FOSS encourages collaboration, customization,
and community-driven development, ultimately leading to more accessible and
affordable software solutions.  
James Shrestha delved into the realm of OpenStreetMap, a collaborative mapping
project that allows users to contribute, edit, and access free geographic
data. He demonstrated how OpenStreetMap empowers individuals and communities
to create, improve, and utilize open maps for various purposes, such as
navigation, disaster management, and urban planning.  
By the end of the orientation program, participants gained a deeper
understanding of Open Data, Free and Open Source Software, and OpenStreetMap.
They were equipped with the knowledge and awareness needed to leverage these
open technologies for their personal, academic, and professional endeavors.  
The orientation program served as an important stepping stone for the Open
Tech Community in promoting openness, collaboration, and the adoption of open
technologies. It fostered an environment of learning and sharing, encouraging
individuals to explore the potential of these tools and contribute to the
larger open tech ecosystem.
