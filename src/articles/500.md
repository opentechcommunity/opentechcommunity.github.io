Summary: On June 3, 2022, the Open Tech Community organized an orientation
program at "PN Campus" to introduce and educate participants about Open Data,
Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), and OpenStreetMap. The program aimed to
create awareness among attendees about the importance and benefits of these
open technologies.  
The orientation program was led by three knowledgeable speakers: Nirab
Pudasaini, Arjun Gautam, and James Shrestha. Each speaker brought their
expertise and insights to the session, ensuring a comprehensive understanding
of the topics covered.  
Open Data, a key focus of the program, refers to the concept of making data
freely available to the public, allowing for its reuse and redistribution. The
participants learned about the significance of open data in promoting
transparency, collaboration, and innovation in various domains, including
government, research, and business.  
Another crucial aspect covered during the program was Free and Open Source
Software (FOSS). The speakers shed light on the principles and advantages of
using FOSS, emphasizing its cost-effectiveness, customizability, and the
community-driven development model. Participants gained insights into
different FOSS applications and their potential to meet various software
needs.  
OpenStreetMap, a collaborative mapping project, was also introduced to the
attendees. They learned about the power of OpenStreetMap as a freely
accessible and editable map of the world, created and maintained by a global
community. The speakers demonstrated how OpenStreetMap empowers individuals
and organizations to contribute to accurate and up-to-date geographic
information, benefiting various sectors such as disaster management, urban
planning, and navigation.  
The orientation program at "PN Campus" provided an excellent opportunity for
participants to familiarize themselves with Open Data, Free and Open Source
Software, and OpenStreetMap. The interactive sessions and insights shared by
the speakers fostered a better understanding of the open technology ecosystem
and its potential applications in diverse fields.  
By organizing such events, the Open Tech Community continues to play a vital
role in promoting knowledge sharing, collaboration, and the adoption of open
technologies among individuals and organizations.
