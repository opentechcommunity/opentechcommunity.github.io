The collaborative efforts of several dynamic communities culminated in a
groundbreaking event, "Mapping Mania," which took place on July 21, 2023. The
event was a triumphant showcase of the potential and versatility of
OpenStreetMap (OSM) technology. Co-organized by the Open Tech Community,
MapBuds, and Open Mapping Hub Asia-Pacific, the event aimed to delve into the
world of open-source mapping and its myriad applications. With strong support
from technical and media partners, as well as the venue partner, the event
proved to be an enlightening experience for participants and attendees alike.

## Diverse Perspectives, Singular Goal

  
Mapping Mania brought together a diverse range of perspectives, united by a
singular goal: to harness the power of open-source mapping for positive
change. The event's comprehensive agenda featured sessions that catered to
participants at all levels of expertise, ensuring that beginners and seasoned
mappers alike could find value in the discussions.  
The event commenced with an insightful presentation by Gaurav Shah from
COESIS, providing an overview of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and its
relevance in the modern tech landscape. This set the stage for deeper
exploration into the world of open-source mapping.  
Sushma Ghimire, representing Kathmandu Living Labs (KLL), then took the stage
to introduce OpenStreetMap (OSM) and shed light on its wide-ranging use cases.
Participants were treated to real-world examples of how OSM has been leveraged
for various purposes, from urban planning to disaster response.

## Hands-On Learning and Inspiring Stories

  
The event didn't just stop at theory; it encouraged practical engagement with
OSM technology. Amrit K. Aryal, hailing from Innovation Lab Pvt. Ltd., led a
hands-on session guiding participants through the process of creating their
own OSM user IDs and delving into basic live mapping. This interactive
workshop proved to be a hit, enabling attendees to take their first steps in
the world of OSM.  
Feye Andal, a YouthMappers Regional Ambassador, captivated the audience with a
session focused on OSM's humanitarian applications. Through firsthand accounts
and compelling stories, Andal underscored how OSM has become an indispensable
tool in aiding communities during crises and disasters.  
The mapping workshop continued under the adept guidance of Ashok Rebmad
Thakulla, allowing participants to refine their mapping skills and learn
advanced techniques.

## Innovation and Community Building

  
Arjun Gautam, representing the Open Tech Community, then turned the spotlight
on innovative ideas and products within the realm of OpenStreetMap. Gautam's
session showcased the innovative spirit that drives the open-source mapping
community, highlighting the potential for groundbreaking creations that can
make a positive impact on society.  
Nishan K. Aryal, a YouthMappers Regional Ambassador for Asia Pacific, delved
into the concept of community within the OSM ecosystem. His session, titled
"Into OSM Community," explored the collaborative nature of OSM mapping
projects and how individuals can become active contributors to this global
movement.

## A Grand Finale

  
The event reached its crescendo with a group presentation by mapping
participants, followed by the announcement of the winners by the COESIS team.
The presentations demonstrated the fruits of the participants' labor,
showcasing a wide array of mapping projects that spanned from local community
mapping to broader regional initiatives.  
Mapping Mania, with its diverse sessions and interactive workshops, left an
indelible mark on all who attended. By bringing together communities, experts,
and enthusiasts, the event underscored the power of OpenStreetMap technology
to drive positive change and create a more informed and connected world. As
the curtains closed on this event, participants departed with a newfound
appreciation for open-source mapping and a heightened sense of camaraderie
