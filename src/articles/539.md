The world of technology is ever-evolving, and it thrives on collaboration,
innovation, and inclusivity. As advocates of open-source technology and
enthusiasts of all things tech-related, we recently gathered for our quarterly
meetup to discuss ways to build and sustain our beloved Open Tech Community.
This meetup brought together individuals from diverse backgrounds, all with a
common goal of nurturing a thriving open tech ecosystem.

## Attendees:

  
Bhawak Pokhrel from Kathmandu Living Labs, a mobile engineer with a passion
for open tech.  
Sagar Ghimire from Datopian and Open Knowledge Nepal, a talented data engineer
dedicated to the open-source cause.  
Arjun Gautam from the Open Tech Community, a web engineer and one of the
driving forces behind our community's success.

## Nurturing Sustainability

  
One of the central themes of our discussion was the importance of building a
sustainable open tech community. Sustainability, in this context, encompasses
not just the environmental aspect but also the longevity and vitality of our
community. Here are some key takeaways:  
1\. Fostering Collaboration: Collaboration is the lifeblood of open tech
communities. To ensure our community thrives, we need to actively seek out
opportunities to collaborate with like-minded organizations and individuals.
This includes forging partnerships with other tech communities in Nepal and
beyond, which can lead to fruitful projects and initiatives.  
2\. Empowering Skill Development: Our community is only as strong as its
members. To ensure long-term sustainability, we discussed the importance of
empowering individuals with the necessary skills to contribute effectively.
This can involve mentorship programs, workshops, and educational initiatives
to nurture the next generation of open tech enthusiasts.  
3\. Diverse Activities: Diversity in activities keeps the community engaged
and attracts a broader audience. We're proud of our ongoing activities such as
hackathons, mapathons, and data-related projects. These events not only
provide opportunities for learning and growth but also serve as a way to
involve different segments of the community.  
4\. Strengthening Bonds: Building strong relationships within our community is
crucial. We discussed the need for regular meetups, both online and offline,
to strengthen bonds and foster a sense of belonging. Strong relationships are
the foundation of any thriving community.

## Ongoing Community Initiatives

  
During our meetup, we also had the chance to delve into the ongoing community
activities taking place in various cities across Nepal. From hackathons that
spur innovation to mapathons that enhance our understanding of geography,
these initiatives are vital for our community's growth.  
Additionally, we explored opportunities to engage with other tech communities,
focusing on areas such as data, free and open-source software (FOSS),
OpenStreetMap, and open hardware. These collaborations can lead to a wealth of
knowledge sharing and cross-pollination of ideas, ultimately benefiting
everyone involved.

## Conclusion

  
Our quarterly meetup served as a reminder of the incredible potential and
strength of our Open Tech Community. By fostering collaboration, empowering
skill development, diversifying our activities, and strengthening bonds, we
are well on our way to building a thriving and sustainable community.  
As we move forward, we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and
the positive impact we can have on the world of open technology. Together, we
will continue to make strides in the realms of data, FOSS, OpenStreetMap, and
open hardware, all while contributing to the ever-growing open tech ecosystem.  
Stay tuned for more updates from the Open Tech Community, and join us in our
mission to create a brighter, more open future for technology.
