awareness, fostering collaboration, and supporting the growth of open source
technologies within the country.  
The activities that were considered during the meeting included:  
Workshops and Training Programs: Organizing workshops and training sessions to
educate individuals and organizations about the benefits and usage of FOSS.
These programs would aim to build technical skills and promote the adoption of
open source software.  
Community Events and Meetups: Hosting regular community events and meetups
where like-minded individuals and enthusiasts can come together to share
knowledge, exchange ideas, and collaborate on FOSS projects. These events
would provide networking opportunities and foster a sense of community among
FOSS advocates.

individuals, businesses, and society as a whole. These campaigns could involve
public talks, seminars, and media outreach.  
Contribution to Open Source Projects: Encouraging community members to
contribute to existing open source projects or initiate new projects aligned
with local needs. This activity would promote active participation, knowledge
sharing, and collaboration within the FOSS ecosystem.  
Collaboration with Educational Institutions: Establishing partnerships with
educational institutions to integrate FOSS-related topics into the curriculum,
organize guest lectures, and facilitate student involvement in FOSS projects.
This would help create a strong foundation and nurture the next generation of
FOSS contributors.  
Policy Advocacy: Engaging with government bodies, policy-makers, and industry
stakeholders to advocate for policies that support the adoption and growth of
FOSS in Nepal. This activity aims to create an enabling environment for open
source technologies and promote their benefits across various sectors.  
The meeting concluded with a commitment to further explore these activities
and develop an action plan for their implementation. The Open Tech Community
aims to actively contribute to the FOSS movement in Nepal by organizing
events, providing resources, and fostering collaboration among individuals and
organizations passionate about open source technologies.
