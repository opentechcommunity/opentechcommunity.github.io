On April 21, 2022, the Open Tech Community organized an orientation program at
the Institute of Crisis Management Studies. The focus of the program was to
introduce and provide insights into three key areas: Open Data, Free and Open
Source Software (FOSS), and OpenStreetMap. The program aimed to raise
awareness and promote the adoption of these open technologies among the
participants.  
The orientation program was conducted by four experts in their respective
fields: Nirab Pudasaini, Manoj Thapa, James Shrestha, and Arjun Gautam. Each
expert shared their knowledge and experiences related to the topic, delivering
informative sessions to the participants.  
The program covered the following areas:  
Open Data: The participants were introduced to the concept of Open Data, which
refers to the idea of making certain types of data freely available for anyone
to access, use, and share. The session provided an overview of the benefits of
Open Data, its impact on various sectors, and the potential it holds for
innovation and development.  
Free and Open Source Software (FOSS): This session focused on the significance
of FOSS and its relevance in today's technology landscape. The participants
learned about the principles behind FOSS, its advantages, and how it differs
from proprietary software. The session also highlighted successful examples of
FOSS and encouraged participants to explore and contribute to open-source
projects.  
OpenStreetMap: The participants were introduced to OpenStreetMap (OSM), a
collaborative mapping platform that allows users to create and edit maps using
crowd-sourced data. The session provided an overview of OSM's features, its
global community, and its applications in various domains such as disaster
response, urban planning, and transportation. Participants learned how they
could contribute to improving the accuracy and completeness of OpenStreetMap
data.  
The orientation program at the Institute of Crisis Management Studies
successfully familiarized the participants with Open Data, FOSS, and
OpenStreetMap. The experts' knowledge sharing and interactive sessions
provided valuable insights, fostering a better understanding of the benefits
and possibilities offered by these open technologies. The program aimed to
inspire the participants to explore and contribute to the Open Tech Community
and its endeavors further.
