On April 18, 2022, a meeting was held at Naxal by the Open Tech Community,
with the following individuals in attendance: Bhawak Pokhrel, Nikesh Balami,
Nishan Aryal, James Shrestha, Sagar Ghimire, Manoj Thapa, and Arjun Gautam.
The meeting primarily focused on two key discussion points.  
First, the attendees discussed the organization of an upcoming event called
the "Hackfest." The purpose of the Hackfest was to bring together individuals
interested in technology and open-source software development. During the
meeting, the group deliberated on various aspects of the event, such as its
structure, agenda, and objectives.  
Second, the Open Tech Community members explored the formation of a dedicated
team responsible for planning and executing the Hackfest event. This team
would play a crucial role in coordinating logistics, outreach, sponsorship,
and other essential tasks to ensure the success of the event.  
Additionally, the participants also deliberated on the name for the Hackfest
event, eventually deciding to call it "OSM Hackfest 2022." This name signifies
the focus on open-source technology and serves as a unique identifier for the
event.  
By documenting and summarizing these activities, the Open Tech Community aimed
to provide a transparent overview of their discussions and decisions, laying
the groundwork for further planning and execution of the Hackfest event.
