On May 20, 2022, the Open Tech Community organized an orientation program at
Kathmandu University focused on three key areas: Open Data, Free and Open
Source Software (FOSS), and OpenStreetMap. The program aimed to introduce and
create awareness among the participants about these important aspects of the
open technology movement. The event featured presentations delivered by Nirab
Pudasaini, Saurav Bhattarai, James Shrestha, and Arjun Gautam, who are experts
in their respective fields.  
The orientation program provided an overview of Open Data, emphasizing its
significance in promoting transparency, collaboration, and innovation.
Participants gained insights into the importance of making data accessible to
the public, enabling its use for research, analysis, and development of new
solutions.  
The second focus of the program was Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). The
presenters discussed the philosophy behind FOSS and its advantages, including
the freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute software. They highlighted
various popular FOSS applications and their relevance in different domains,
such as operating systems, office productivity, graphics editing, and web
development.  
OpenStreetMap, a collaborative mapping project, constituted the final segment
of the program. Participants learned about the power of community-driven
mapping and how OpenStreetMap enables individuals to contribute and access
geospatial data. The presenters showcased real-life examples of OpenStreetMap
usage, illustrating its value in disaster response, urban planning, and
transportation management.  
Through this orientation program, the Open Tech Community successfully
disseminated knowledge and created awareness about Open Data, Free and Open
Source Software, and OpenStreetMap. The participants gained a deeper
understanding of these concepts and their potential impact on various sectors.
The event contributed to fostering a culture of openness, collaboration, and
innovation within the technology community at Kathmandu University.
